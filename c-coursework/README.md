# C++ coursework

Hello!
This was my C++ coursework in Easter 2023 to create a game in order to learn the language.
The library used was one created by the lecturer and is a wrapper for SDl.
This should run on windows, but I don't remember how to run it properly at the moment. If you open it in Rider or Visual Studio you should be able to run it though.
There is a memory leak from the image manager provided by the library, unfortunately we weren't allowed to modify the library - there shouldn't be any other memory leaks though.

## Controls
WASD - Move the character
Arrow keys - Shoot bullets
Spacebar - pause the game
Left click - click buttons
